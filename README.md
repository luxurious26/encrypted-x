# Encrypted X (Key Bypass)

Encrypted X - A free access key executor in which the way to get a key is to go through a lot of ads

You can get the latest version without using that **bootstraper**: https://encryptedx.surge.sh/EncryptedUpdater.txt

There are **hidden keys** for developers to make it easier for them to log in, only they can be used by anyone and in this way they can use the executor.
